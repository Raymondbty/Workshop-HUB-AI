# Workshop: Creating a Simple Chess AI with PyTorch

## Workshop Objective

This workshop will guide you through creating a simplified chess AI using Python and PyTorch. While the AI won't be competitive, it will provide you with a basic understanding of the development process for a chess AI.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python.
- Python and PyTorch installed.
- [python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for chess game manipulation.

## Workshop Duration

This workshop is designed to last approximately 2.5 hours.

## Contents

### Step 1: Data Collection (15 minutes)

To simplify, we will generate random chess games as collecting real data is a complex and time-consuming process.

### Step 2: Creating the Deep Learning Model (15 minutes)

Using a simple neural network model.

### Step 3: Model Training (1 hour)

Using random data for the example. Real training would require real training data.

### Step 4: Implementing a Simple Chess Engine (15 minutes)

Creating a function to play chess using the model.

### Step 5: Game Visualization (15 minutes)

Utilizing the [python-chess library](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to display the chess game.

## Required Libraries

In this workshop, you will need to install a few libraries to work with Python, PyTorch, and chess game manipulation. Below are the links and installation commands for each library:

### 1. Python

- **Link:** [Python Installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

   Python is the starting point for AI development, known for its simplicity and versatility.

### 2. PyTorch

- **Link:** [PyTorch Installation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

   PyTorch is a deep learning framework that we will use for building and training the chess AI. To install PyTorch, use the provided link to access installation instructions. The installation command will depend on your system configuration. If you are using pip for Python package management, the installation command may look like this:

```   pip install torch    ```


## 3. python-chess

 ```pip install python-chess```

We will use the python-chess library for manipulating chess games in Python. To install python-chess, open your terminal or command prompt and run the provided installation command. This will download and install the library in your Python environment.
